SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
# Introduction
The goal of this lab project work is to have a deeper knowledge about SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The emphasis on this project is on creating a map of a virtual
simulation of a house using SLAM. Weâ€™ve used trutleBot3 model name waffel and gazebo house world to simulate a navigation throughout an office compound. The layout of this report lists questions from the main lab document followed by answer and practical discussions that arises during the lab work.
